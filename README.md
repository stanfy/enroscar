Enroscar
=======

**A set of Android tools that facilitate apps development**

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stanfy/enroscar.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/stanfy/enroscar)

Well, this repo contains pretty much code used internally at Stanfy to develop Android apps.
Some parts lack documentation and are outdated, we are working on this problem.
Currently we have 2 components that are **definitely worth to check out now:**

* [Goro](goro) - a generic tool for organizing asynchronous tasks in queues and Android service
* [Enroscar Async](async) - a library that helps to put any asynchronous operation behind Android Loader and
  integrate it with [RxJava](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava).
